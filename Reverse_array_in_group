"""
what happend in above query is that   first iteration 
s= 0
e=2
which is fine both start and end are less than  len(a) so tha reverse function is called 

	in 2nd iteration 
	s=3
	e=5 
	
the last two element willvremain as it is without reversing
so to tackle that we will do 

before returnin will chech whetaher
 s<len(a)
 and e> len(a)
 
 this means the remainf element is less than k so to reverse that as well
