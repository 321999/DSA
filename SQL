indexing in sql 

when we wanted to fetch particular row of data from very large dataset we use to use the where clause that serach the 
element in linear fashion and take o(n) time complexiy 

for sorted element we can considere the o(n) time complexity but what about when we have the larger dataset 
so for that we will use indexing 

what indexing will do?
indexing will create a new memory for the partiuclar in sorted order and each rows value of that indexed column will point to the 
to the value of the original table 

let me create the diagram of it

Name	Population	area
A	12	100
B	13	50
C	9	800
  
Say if the query is like wanted t o know the name of whose population is very less 
For that Iâ€™ll be using the where clause which will take o(3)
Name	Population	area
A
12	100
B
13	50
C
9	800

The same can be done in another way as well ,like creating the index cokumn of population
Population
9
12
13

   
Name	Population	area
A	12	100
B	13	50
C	9	800


Know when we use the where clause instead of searching to the original table it will serach on temperaray created the population table and when it got  the pointed the values will be return 
//can we use indexing every scenario?
No we should always use in read intensive based application
